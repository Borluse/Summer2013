<blockquote>
  <p>tk2dCamera has been updated and massively improved. Please refer to <strong><a href="../reference/tk2dcamera.html">this</a></strong> page for more information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tk2dCamera is a solution to make it really simple to work in pixel units, and to make it automatically work with various resolutions without any user intervention.</p>

<p>In order for sprites to work seamlessly with tk2dCamera, you should tick the <strong>tk2dCamera</strong> tickbox in the sprite collection inspector. A similar tickbox exists for fonts, too. </p>

<p><img src="img/tk2dcamera_tickbox.png" alt="tk2dcamera_tickbox"></p>

<p><em>Please keep in mind that while the tk2dCamera is compatible with sprites created with the old method, sprites created with the tk2dCamera tickbox enabled will not auto-size correctly with standard ortho cameras.</em></p>

<h2>Creating a tk2dCamera</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a tk2dCamera by clicking on "Create > tk2d > Camera" in the Hierarchy Window. Alternatively, you can find this menu in "Assets > Create > tk2d > Camera".</p>

<p><img src="img/tk2dcamera_create.png" alt="tk2dcamera_create"></p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you don't have any other cameras in the scene, if you intend on using this camera as your primary 2D Camera.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a sprite to the scene. Refer to <a href="creating_a_sprite_in_the_editor.html">Creating a Sprite in the Editor</a>. Set the sprite collection to <strong>DemoCameraSpriteCollection</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Position the sprite at (100, 100) by entering those numbers into the X and Y components of the transform. </p>

<p><img src="img/tk2dcamera_tutorial_transform.png" alt="tk2dcamera<em>tutorial</em>transform"></p></li>
<li><p>The sprite should be positioned 100 x 100 pixels into the screen, regardless of the resolution. In this example, the game window resolution is set to 480x320, and the heart is positioned 100 x 100 pixels.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: On occasion, when you change the resolution of the game window, the camera doesn't update immediately. Pressing play and stopping will fix the issue.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<h2>Anchors</h2>

<p>The tk2d camera also supports anchors. These anchors will anchor themselves to one of the 9 parts of the screen (corners &amp; centers). You may also specify an offset in pixels for these anchors. The coordinate system for the anchors is exactly the same as the coordinate system for the camera - an offset of (-100, 20) means 100 pixels to the left, and 20 pixels up.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Select the tk2dCamera created in the previous step.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <strong>Create Anchor</strong> in the inspector. A new anchor is created.</p>

<p><img src="img/tk2dcamera_createanchor.png" alt="tk2dcamera_createanchor"></p></li>
<li><p>You can now set up the anchor by setting the <strong>Anchor</strong> point and <strong>Offset</strong> parameters.</p>

<p><img src="img/tk2dcamera_anchor.png" alt="tk2dcamera_anchor"></p></li>
<li><p>Any sprites parented to this anchor will always be anchored to that relative position to the anchor. The hearts below are anchored to a "Top right" anchor and simply positioned using the transform widget.</p>
